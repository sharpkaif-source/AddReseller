# Workflow is Pinned - That's OK!

## ✅ What "Pinned" Means

When a workflow is **pinned**, it means:
- It appears at the top of the Actions page
- It's marked as important/frequently used
- **It doesn't affect the "Run workflow" button**

## 🔍 Where to Find "Run workflow" Button

Even if the workflow is pinned, the "Run workflow" button should still be visible:

### Location 1: On the Workflow Page
1. Go to: https://github.com/sharpkaif-source/AddReseller/actions/workflows/reseller-bot.yml
2. Look at the **top-right** of the page
3. You should see a blue **"Run workflow"** button

### Location 2: From Actions Tab
1. Go to: https://github.com/sharpkaif-source/AddReseller/actions
2. Click **"Create Reseller Bot"** in the left sidebar
3. On the right side, look for **"Run workflow"** button

## 📍 Visual Guide

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Create Reseller Bot                    │
│                                         │
│  [Workflow runs list...]                │
│                                         │
│                    [Run workflow] ← HERE│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔄 To Unpin (Optional)

If you want to unpin it:
1. Click **"Unpin this workflow?"** (if you see it)
2. Confirm the action
3. The workflow will still work the same way

**Note:** Pinning/unpinning doesn't affect functionality - it's just a UI organization feature.

## 🚀 Quick Test

Try this direct link:
https://github.com/sharpkaif-source/AddReseller/actions/workflows/reseller-bot.yml

On this page, the "Run workflow" button should be visible on the **right side**.

## 💡 If Still Can't See It

The button might be:
- **Below the workflow runs list** (scroll down)
- **In a dropdown menu** (look for a menu icon)
- **Requires page refresh** (try Ctrl + F5)

Or I can trigger it via API for you!
